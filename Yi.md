// Some ideas:
  In addition of having tentative schedules, we can have some customizable options for the user to choose, to show the user
  differnt kinds of schedule from his or her preference. Starting from entering the number of classes the user is planning 
  take, we can have the basic options such as department(s), lower or upper divison to some advanced options like which days
  a week, morning or late, classes one next to one another or classes spread through the day, and so on. We can possibly
  generate several schedules based on the user's preferences.
